<div style="text-align: center;"> <h3> <b> Pacific Northwest Ag Climate Tools </b> </h3> </div>

<p> 
Our mission is to provide management-oriented climate-change decision support systems for Pacific (PNW) agriculture.
</p>

<h4> <b> Vision </b> </h4>
<p> 
The PNW region's research community has made advances in characterizing the impacts of climate change on agriculture. However, there is a significant gap in translating this into specific management implications that are relevant and useful for risk analysis and decision making. Our vision is to be at the forefront of bridging this gap one step at a time. We believe this is achievable through partnerships with research and extension groups/agencies that are actively involved in current growing season decision support for agriculture, and the users of these tools.

<h4> <b> Our current focus: codling moth </b> </h4>
<p> 
As a first step, this website is a means to explore changing codling moth pressures, and associated pest management implications for the Washington State tree fruit industry. Expected changes to bloom timing in multiple apple varieties are also available. This is one part of a broader ongoing collaboration between the Washington State University's (WSU) <a href="http://csanr.wsu.edu/">Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources</a> (CSANR) and the WSU <a href="http://www.tfrec.wsu.edu/">Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center</a> (TFREC) to characterize production risks and management implications of a changing climate on Northwest tree fruit production. We have also initiated collaborations with other aspects of Pacific Northwest agriculture. So stay tuned for more this year!

<h4> <b> Why the codling moth? </b> </h4>
<p> 
The codling moth is a primary pest affecting tree fruit; its larvae feed on the fruit making it unmarketable. Without management, damage can lead to over 90% fruit loss, making pest management key to a viable and successful regional tree-fruit industry. Given that insect occurrence and growth are primarily temperature-driven, warming is expected to affect their physiology, phenology, and spatial distribution. This will change expected pest pressures, and strategies for pest management. 
<br />
The growth and management of the codling moth are relatively well understood and translated into a model that is part of the WSU tree fruit <a href="https://decisionaid.systems/">Decision Aid System</a> (DAS): a weather-based model used for integrated pest management on more than 90% of Washington State tree-fruit acres. We leverage this knowledge and use it as a starting point to explore what future temperatures might mean. So join us and explore changing codling moth pressures, and associated pest management implications for the Washington State tree fruit industry. You can start with "What's the story?" on the left sidebar to get a quick summary.
