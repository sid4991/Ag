# Kirti,
# The page I sent you the other day with the fruit 
# growth models had a transcription error for Fuji 
# - when I copied the coefficient for the squared 
# term, I accidentally put -1.76e-08, it should have been -1.76e-07.  
# Its correct in this version.

coefficient_squared_Fuji <- -1.76e-07
