Afterplotting the double peak NDVIs and their corresponding acerage, Kirti
wanted to know what is the actual double-cropped fields in 2017.
However, there is no Note for 2017 data. So, we created this for 2015, 2016 and 2018
to see how much acerage are there per county.


The file WSDA_only_yr_dbl_double_summary corresponds to acerage of files
that are corrected by years. i.e. each file actually is filtered by lastSurveyDate == a year.


The file WSDA_yr_and_prior_dbl_double_summary corresponds to not filtered
data of WSDA where each shapefile is actually for a given year and prior years!!!!
