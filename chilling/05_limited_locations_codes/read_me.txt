The historical data here, in density plots, are
modeled historical and therefore,
it goes from 1950 to 2005.

The future periods are 2025-2050, 2051-2075 and 2076-2099.

The data from 2006-205 are omitted to be consistent with Kirti's 
non-overlapping time frames mentioned above.

Please note, there are two plots here, rcp45 and rcp85, both includes
historical, but historical data do not have rcp's in them.
So, both plots share the same historical data.
