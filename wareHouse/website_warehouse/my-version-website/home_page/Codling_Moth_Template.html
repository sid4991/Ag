		    <b> Codling Moth Life cycle </b> 
	    </h5>
	</div>
	
	<p>
		The codling moth overwinters as a mature larva 
		in a silk cocoon. In early spring, the overwintering 
		larvae begin pupation, progress to the adult growth 
		stage, mate, and lay eggs which hatch into larvae. 
		In orchards, the larvae find and burrow into the 
		fruit, usually within approximately one day after 
		hatching. The larvae grow and mature in the fruit, 
		coming out to build their cocoon and overwinter or 
		pupate. And the cycle begins again. Each cycle is 
		called a generation of the pest. In Washington state, 
		we typically experience two full generations, and in 
		some warm years a partial third generation of the codling moth.

	<p>
		Within each generation, a certain proportion of 
		larvae pupate and start the next generation cycle. 
		The rest go into a state of delayed development and 
		inactivity (diapause induction). If these diapause-induced 
		larvae reach full growth, they will overwinter successfully. 
		Sometimes, the last generation diapause-induced larvae 
		do not receive enough growing degree day accumulation 
		to grow enough to successfully overwinter.
		<br />
		The fraction of larvae that are diapause-induced 
		versus those that pupate is a function of the 
		photoperiod or day length. When the days are shorter, 
		a larger fraction of the larvae are diapause-induced 
		for overwintering and a smaller fraction pupate into 
		the next generation. When the days are longer, a smaller 
		fraction is diapause-induced for overwintering, and a 
		larger fraction pupates into the next generation.

	<p>
		Field measures at selected tree-fruit growing 
		locations in Washington State helped develop an 
		empirical relationship between day length and 
		the percentage of larvae that were diapause-induced 
		(or conversely, the percent that escaped diapause-induction and pupated). In Washington State, almost 100% of larvae are diapause-induced before mid-April and after late 
		August. Diapause-induced larvae that emerged in 
		August sometimes do not accumulate enough growing 
		degree days to mature enough to overwinter successfully.

	<p>
		Codling moth growth is primarily temperature-driven, 
		as is the case with cold-blooded insects in general. 
		Degree day models have been used successfully in 
		forecasting the timing of growth stages, and these 
		models are commonly used to provide integrated pest 
		management decision support such as through the WSU 
		Tree-Fruit Decision Aid System (DAS). Our analyses 
		are based on the degree day models for codling moth 
		developed for and used in DAS.

	<h4> <b> <u> Codling Moth Management Strategies </u> </b> </h4>
	<p>
		Codling moth management aims to disrupt three 
		developmental stages: eggs, newly hatched larvae, 
		and adults. Eggs can be prevented from hatching with 
		topical or residual pesticides. Parasitoid wasps such 
		as Trichogramma have also been shown to help suppress 
		codling moth populations by attacking the egg stage. 
		Newly hatched codling moth larvae can be targeted with 
		residual pesticides or with the codling moth granulosis 
		virus. Applications targeting the newly hatched 
		larvae need to be timed perfectly, because the 
		larvae enter the safety of the fruit within a 
		day of hatching. Finally, mating disruption is 
		directed at the adult codling moths. It delays 
		and prevents mating and, thus, leads to a substantial 
		reduction of eggs laid in the orchard. Management 
		programs combine these strategies in one way or 
		another to keep fruit damage below the economic threshold.

		Tree-Fruit Decision Aid System to inform 
		the strategies and timing of codling moth 
		control efforts, please see
