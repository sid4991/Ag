<h4> <b>Changing Codling Moth Pest Pressures: What's the story? </b> </h4>
<ol>

  <li> 
    <b>
	    We expect to see a higher codling moth risk-more number of generations and stronger generations-as temperatures get warmer. 
    </b> <br />
    Historically Washington State has experienced two full generation cycles of the codling moth and a partial third generation in warmer areas. By the 2040s, all of Washington is projected to experience a full third generation each year. Some areas even face a significant fourth generation of codling moth by the 2040s, and this risk becomes more widespread further out into the future. Check out the "Pest risk" tab.
    <br />
    <b><u> Management implication </u></b> <br />
    Increased pest risk implies the need for additional sprays, a larger range of chemicals, and an increased cost of pest control. It also implies increased pesticide resistance risks.
  </li>

  <li> 
    <b>
	We expect to see all codling moth development stages starting earlier. 
    </b> <br />
    The first flight of the overwintering generation and all subsequent phenological events are projected to begin earlier in the year. The projected advancement is about 8 days on average every 20 years. The shift in the timing of these events also has implications for the relative fraction of larvae that get diapause-induced versus progressing to emerge as adult moths. Check out the "Codling Moth Flight" and "Codling Moth Egg Hatch" tabs. 
    <br />
    <b><u>
	Management implication
    </u></b> <br />
    Timing of sprays will need to be shifted accordingly. Traps need to be set earlier than typically done in the region, or the ideal window for control measures might be missed.
  </li>

  <li> 
    <b>
	We expect to see a greater proportion of the first generation overwintering and causing damage the following year. In contrast, a greater proportion of the second generation causes damage in the current year. 
    </b> <br />
    The relative fraction of larvae getting diapause-induced (and therefore overwintering until next season) versus pupating (and progressing to the next generation that same season) is a function of the day length (see codling moth life cycle tab for more details). When days are shorter, a larger fraction of larvae get diapause-induced. Conversely, when days are longer, a smaller fraction of larvae get diapause-induced. With earlier development, the first generation eggs hatch into larvae earlier in the year when the days are still short, so a larger fraction of them get diapause-induced and overwinter, thereby requiring control the following year. On the other hand, earlier development means the second generation eggs hatching into larvae when the days are longer and the relative fraction of larvae escaping diapause and causing further issues in the current year is larger. Check out the "Diapause" tab.
    <br />
    <b><u>
	Management implication
    </u></b> <br />
    More control than currently typical might be needed to address the second generation of codling moth.
  </li>

  <li>
     <b>
	 We expect to see a shorter window of time for effective control, but control mechanisms such as pesticides and mating disruption will work better under warmer climates.
     </b> <br />
     Warming leads to accelerated degree day accumulation, so that more of the pest population pass through susceptible stages for pest control for a given pesticide residual time, making pesticide treatments more effective. However, the window of opportunity for control is smaller, and even a day's delay can allow significant number of larvae to enter the fruit and cause damage. Similarly, mating delay is a function of degree day accumulation. Faster accumulation implies that a within a given delay, there will be much larger decrease in the population of fertilized eggs.
     <br />
     <b><u>
	Management implication
	     </u></b> <br />
    The window of opportunity for control is shorter, and it is critical to capture it right. However, if captured correctly, there might be benefits in terms of more effective control.
