# Pacific Northwest (PNW) AG Climate Tools

## Mission

Provide management-oriented climate-change decision support systems for PNW agriculture.

## Vision

As a research community, we have made advances in characterizing the impacts of climate change on agriculture. However, there is a significant gap in translating this into specific management implications relevant/useful for risk-analysis and decision-making. PNW Ag Climate Tool's vision is to be at the forefront of bridging this gap one step at a time. We believe this is achievable through partnerships with research and extension groups, and agencies that are actively involved in current growing season decision support for agriculture.
